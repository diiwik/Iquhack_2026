1. Problem Statement

The Low Autocorrelation Binary Sequence (LABS) problem is a combinatorial optimization task with applications in radar, communications, and signal processing. Classical solvers such as Memetic Tabu Search (MTS) achieve strong performance but still exhibit exponential scaling, making large problem sizes computationally expensive.

Near-term quantum devices cannot yet solve LABS end-to-end due to:

Limited qubit counts

Noise

Circuit depth constraints

There is a need for a hybrid quantum–classical approach that provides practical, near-term performance gains without requiring fault-tolerant quantum hardware.

2. Product Vision

Use quantum computation as a structured global sampler to generate high-quality candidate solutions, which are then refined classically using MTS.

The quantum component does not replace classical optimization — it enhances it.
